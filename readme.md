# Vue mini-demo
## This repo demonstrates the usage of VueJS when integrated into an existing HTML page
1. We‚Äôre starting off from a static HTML page with some text
1. We are then adding a div which will be the root element for a Vue app with some logic
1. After that, we are coding the app itself ‚Äì letting Vue control that div, leaving the other parts of the HTML page untouched
1. Finally, we apply a few slight structural changes in the app, to see how modern JavaScript code can be organized into convenient ES6 modules.

You can see the progress step by step by individually checking out the tags:
